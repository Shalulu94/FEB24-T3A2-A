# Salzy Cakes - Term 3 Coder Academy Assignment

## Purpose

Salzy Cakes is a small business based in Melbourne selling customisable baked goods - specifically cakes!

After speaking with the business we have identified a few challenges in which a web app could help:

1. Currently they market products and connect with customers via Facebook and Instagram. While this is so far effective, they are then required to manage the orders on a separate excel sheet manually which can prove time consuming and subject to errors when dealing with lots of orders. Main functionality of the web app is to include a storefront which showcases all products and allows users to place orders directly and have this data organised in a relevant database.

2. Personal customisations - A big sell point for Salzy cakes is their ability to customise cakes to their cstomer's preferences. As such, we need to ensure the ordering process includes a free text field in which customer's can add a description of what sort of customisation is required (eg. Gender reveal filling,  themed decorations)

3. Centralised communication - Managing communications between FB and Instagram can get messy, so in addition to placing orders we would like to add a thread within an order which will allow both Sally (Owner) and customers to communicate with each other. This will ensure all comms can take place in a central repository

4. Customer Data - Another challenge is Salzy cakes posts monthly special cakes but she has no way of capturing customer details (mobile, email) in which she can send out monthly marketing to attract return sales. Having this order system on the web app will also require some login authentication so users will need to sign up when making a purchase to allocate the order to them. This will also allow Sally to capture details for future marketing.

The features of this application will be the solutions to the challenges discussed above.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this application would be any customer looking to purchase a cake for an event that they would like customised to match a specific theme or event. There is no specific gender or age related demographic.

Some suggestions which will also be included in our user stories include:

- Customers looking for a gender reveal cake which requires specific coloured fillings
- Birthday cakes with personalised messaging
- Cake customised for a specific theme such as a "Winnie the Pooh" themed cake

The possibilities are endless however the request needs to be reasonable and achievable within given time frames. This is why it is important to include the free-text communcation field between the customer and owner to ensure all details are captured in the order. 

## Tech Stack

This will be a MERN project, so we will be utilising the following tech stack:

- **MongoDB** - Mongo for the back-end database
- **Express** - Back-end framework for building API's with NodeJS
- **React** - To handle all our front-end development
- **NodeJS** - To assist with server side functions
